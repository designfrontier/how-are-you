# How Are You?

a simple tool for getting a random question for your 1:1s. It uses a large bank of questions
as well as the questions from https://qz.com/work/1836105/20-great-questions-to-ask-instead-of-how-are-you-doing-right-now/

It keeps track of the questions you have asked each team member so that you
don't repeat them.
